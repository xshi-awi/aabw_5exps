\begin{abstract}
Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is a critical component of the global meridional overturning circulation,
driving abyssal ventilation, heat storage, and carbon sequestration on centennial to millennial timescales.
Despite its importance, the mechanisms governing AABW formation across different climate states remain
poorly understood. Here we investigate AABW production during five paleoclimate periods---preindustrial (PI),
mid-Holocene (MH), Last Interglacial (LIG), Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3)---using
the AWI-ESM coupled climate model. Through water mass transformation (WMT) analysis and surface buoyancy flux
decomposition using the xbudget framework, we quantify the relative contributions of thermal (longwave, shortwave,
sensible, and latent heat) and haline (sea ice and precipitation-evaporation-runoff) forcing to AABW precursor
water formation. Our results reveal a fundamental shift in formation mechanisms between climate states:
during interglacial periods (PI/MH/LIG), heat fluxes dominate AABW precursor water production (85--90\%), whereas
glacial conditions (LGM/MIS3) exhibit enhanced sea ice-driven transformation (25--30\% contribution). Surface
flux decomposition reveals that glacial conditions paradoxically \textit{reduce} ocean heat loss despite colder
atmospheric temperatures, as expanded sea ice insulates the bulk ocean while concentrating brine rejection in
coastal polynyas---a dual role that fundamentally restructures surface forcing of AABW formation. Ideal age
tracer simulations demonstrate that AABW ventilation ages during LGM/MIS3 exceed preindustrial values by
approximately 1,500 years, consistent with paleoceanographic proxy reconstructions. In contrast, the LIG Ross Sea
exhibits anomalously young ventilation ages attributed to reduced sea ice and enhanced thermal forcing. These
findings provide mechanistic insights into how sea ice governs AABW formation response to climate forcing
and contribute to understanding of deep ocean carbon storage variations across glacial-interglacial cycles.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The critical role of Antarctic Bottom Water in the climate system}

Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) represents the densest and coldest water mass in the global ocean, 
ventilating the abyssal ocean and playing a fundamental role in the global meridional overturning 
circulation (MOC) \citep{Orsi1999, Marshall2012}. Forming primarily around the Antarctic continental 
margin, AABW sinks to the ocean floor and spreads northward through the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific 
basins, constituting the lower limb of the global overturning circulation \citep{Talley2013}. The 
Southern Ocean, where AABW originates, is increasingly recognized as the region where deep waters 
return to the surface through wind-driven upwelling, effectively closing the global MOC 
\citep{Marshall2012}. This dual-cell structure---with northward-flowing NADW above and 
southward-spreading AABW below---fundamentally controls the ocean's capacity to store and transport 
heat, carbon, and nutrients on centennial to millennial timescales.

The climatic significance of AABW extends far beyond its role in ocean circulation. Observations 
from repeat hydrographic sections reveal that the deep ocean below 4,000~m has accumulated heat 
at a rate of 12.9$\pm$1.8~TW since the mid-1980s, with the strongest warming signals near 
AABW source regions \citep{Purkey2010}. This abyssal warming contributes approximately 0.1~mm/yr 
to global sea level rise through thermal expansion and represents a significant component of Earth's 
energy imbalance \citep{Purkey2010}. Simultaneously, AABW has undergone substantial volume 
contraction, with the coldest and densest water classes disappearing fastest 
\citep{Purkey2012, Gunn2023}. Recent projections suggest that under high-emission scenarios, 
Antarctic meltwater could drive more than 40\% slowdown of abyssal overturning by 2050 
\citep{Li2023Nature}, with profound implications for ocean biogeochemistry and climate.

The Southern Ocean's role in the global carbon cycle is equally critical. As the primary pathway 
for deep water ventilation, the Southern Ocean mediates carbon exchange between the deep ocean 
reservoir and the atmosphere \citep{Marinov2006, Gray2024}. The Antarctic Polar Front acts as a 
biogeochemical divide, with AABW formation and sinking carrying unutilized nutrients and respired 
carbon to depth \citep{Marinov2006}. The efficiency of this biological carbon pump, and thus 
atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations, depends sensitively on the rate and properties of AABW 
formation. The most comprehensive synthesis indicates that the Southern Ocean absorbs approximately 
40\% of oceanic anthropogenic CO$_2$ uptake, underscoring its central role in modulating 
climate change \citep{Gray2024, Rintoul2025}.

\subsection{Modern understanding of AABW formation mechanisms}

AABW formation occurs through the production and export of Dense Shelf Water (DSW) from four 
primary source regions: the Weddell Sea, Ross Sea, Adélie Coast, and Cape Darnley polynya 
\citep{Orsi1999, Ohshima2013}. The fundamental process involves transformation of surface and 
intermediate waters into extremely dense shelf waters through two interrelated mechanisms: 
intense surface heat loss and brine rejection during sea ice formation in coastal polynyas 
\citep{Silvano2023Frontiers, Ohshima2016}. High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW) forms when 
persistent offshore katabatic winds maintain open-water polynyas, exposing the ocean surface 
to intense cooling while simultaneously enhancing sea ice production and associated brine 
rejection \citep{Miller2023, Ohshima2022}. The resulting HSSW, with salinities exceeding 
34.6~g/kg, either descends directly down the continental slope or first interacts with 
floating ice shelves to form even colder Ice Shelf Water (ISW) below $-2$°C 
\citep{Silvano2023Frontiers}.

The relative importance of thermal versus haline forcing in driving DSW formation varies 
regionally and seasonally. At Cape Darnley, intense sea ice production through frazil ice 
formation dominates, with underwater frazil penetrating depths exceeding 80~m and preventing 
heat-insulating surface ice from forming \citep{Ohshima2022}. This process enables highly 
efficient brine rejection and accounts for 6--13\% of circumpolar AABW production 
\citep{Ohshima2013}. In contrast, the Ross and Weddell Seas exhibit more complex interactions 
between polynya-driven HSSW production and ice shelf cavity circulation, with approximately 
50\% of DSW export involving ISW mixing \citep{Williams2008, Silvano2020}. Recent observations 
demonstrate that glacial meltwater input can partially offset brine injection; in the Amundsen 
Sea and Sabrina Coast, freshwater from basal melting prevents full-depth convection despite 
strong polynya activity \citep{Silvano2018}.

Climate variability strongly modulates AABW production on interannual to decadal timescales. 
The Weddell Sea has experienced a 30\% reduction in bottom water volume since 1992, 
driven primarily by more than 40\% decline in sea ice formation rates associated with northerly 
wind trends linked to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation \citep{Zhou2023}. Conversely, the 
Ross Sea exhibited recovery of AABW salinity, density, and thickness between 2015--2019, caused 
by anomalous wind forcing from positive Southern Annular Mode combined with extreme El Niño 
events that enhanced local sea ice formation \citep{Silvano2020}. These observations highlight 
the sensitivity of AABW production to both local surface forcing and remote climate teleconnections.

\subsection{Water mass transformation framework for AABW analysis}

The water mass transformation (WMT) framework provides a thermodynamic approach to quantifying 
how air-sea fluxes drive changes in water mass properties and thus constrain rates of dense 
water formation \citep{Walin1982, Groeskamp2019}. Originally developed by \citet{Walin1982} 
to relate surface heat fluxes to cross-isothermal mass transport, the framework was subsequently 
extended by \citet{Speer1992} to incorporate both thermal and freshwater contributions to 
surface density flux:
\begin{equation}
f_\rho = \frac{\alpha Q_{net}}{c_p} - \rho \beta S (E - P)
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the thermal expansion and haline contraction coefficients, 
$Q_{net}$ is the net surface heat flux, and $(E-P)$ represents net evaporation minus 
precipitation. The transformation rate across a given density surface is then obtained by 
integrating this density flux over the outcrop area \citep{Groeskamp2019}.

Modern implementations of WMT analysis decompose surface fluxes into multiple components to 
isolate specific physical processes \citep{Iudicone2008a, Iudicone2008b}. Heat flux contributions 
can be separated into shortwave radiation (accounting for penetrative effects), longwave 
radiation, sensible heat, and latent heat fluxes \citep{Iudicone2008a}. Critically, 
\citet{Iudicone2008a} demonstrated that neglecting shortwave penetration can cause 100\% 
errors in water mass formation estimates, particularly in the Southern Ocean where penetrative 
radiation affects mixed layer dynamics. Freshwater flux decomposition distinguishes between 
sea ice formation/melt, glacial meltwater, and precipitation-evaporation-runoff 
\citep{Abernathey2016, Bailey2023}. The sea ice component proves particularly important for 
AABW studies, as it acts as a ``pump'' removing freshwater from high latitudes and concentrating 
brine \citep{Abernathey2016}.

Observation-based WMT analyses have fundamentally advanced understanding of Southern Ocean 
overturning. \citet{Pellichero2018} used Argo floats, ship data, and instrumented marine 
mammals to show that seasonal sea ice growth and melt dominates water mass transformation 
in the ice-covered sector, with freshwater fluxes---rather than heat fluxes---driving the 
meridional overturning that feeds AABW formation. Their estimates indicate approximately 
27$\pm$7~Sv of deep water upwells to the surface, transforming into 22$\pm$4~Sv of lighter 
water (upper cell) and 5$\pm$5~Sv entering denser AABW classes (lower cell) 
\citep{Pellichero2018}. In the Weddell Sea specifically, closed-budget WMT analysis reveals 
minimal precipitation-evaporation-runoff contribution, with sea ice brine rejection dominating 
the surface salt flux throughout most seasons \citep{Bailey2023}.

\subsection{Why paleoclimate AABW research matters: implications for the global carbon cycle}

Understanding AABW variability across glacial-interglacial cycles is fundamental to explaining 
one of the most profound puzzles in Earth system science: the 80--100~ppm atmospheric CO$_2$ 
variations that tightly couple with temperature changes throughout the Quaternary. Ice core 
records demonstrate that CO$_2$ was among the early parameters to change at glacial terminations, 
roughly synchronous with Southern Hemisphere warming and preceding Northern Hemisphere ice 
volume decline \citep{SigmanBoyle2000}. The deep ocean, particularly the abyssal realm dominated 
by AABW, represents the primary carbon reservoir capable of explaining this magnitude of 
CO$_2$ drawdown on glacial-interglacial timescales \citep{SigmanBoyle2000, Kohfeld2005}.

The mechanistic link between AABW and atmospheric CO$_2$ operates through multiple pathways. 
Enhanced AABW formation during glacials, driven by intensified brine rejection from expanded 
sea ice, created strongly stratified deep ocean conditions that effectively isolated 
carbon-rich deep waters from atmospheric exchange \citep{Ferrari2014, Jansen2017}. Model 
studies indicate that at the Last Glacial Maximum, Antarctic-origin waters filled nearly 
the entire ocean volume below 2~km---representing approximately a fourfold increase compared 
to present---while shoaling North Atlantic Deep Water to intermediate depths 
\citep{Ferrari2014}. This reconfigured circulation trapped respired carbon at depth, with 
the Southern Ocean sea ice cap acting as an insulating lid that prevented CO$_2$ outgassing 
\citep{Ferrari2014, Marzocchi2017}. Radiocarbon evidence reveals that glacial deep ocean 
ventilation ages increased by approximately 689$\pm$53~$^{14}$C-yr compared to the Holocene, 
with southern-sourced abyssal waters particularly isolated \citep{Skinner2017}. This 
enhanced isolation could account for more than 50\% of the observed 80--100~ppm glacial 
CO$_2$ drawdown \citep{Skinner2017}.

Beyond its role in glacial CO$_2$ storage, AABW behavior during past warm periods provides 
crucial insights for projecting future climate trajectories. During Marine Isotope Stage 4 
(MIS4; $\sim$70--60~ka), atmospheric CO$_2$ decreased by approximately 40~ppm within 
several thousand years, driven by multiple carbon cycle mechanisms including enhanced AABW 
formation and export that strengthened deep ocean carbon storage \citep{Baggenstos2019}. 
Conversely, interglacial AABW weakening events---as documented during the Last Interglacial 
\citep{Hayes2014} and recurrent across multiple interglacials \citep{Glasscock2020}---demonstrate 
the sensitivity of deep ocean ventilation to high-latitude freshwater forcing. These past 
analogs are particularly relevant given projections of substantial Antarctic ice sheet mass 
loss and associated meltwater discharge under future warming scenarios \citep{Li2023Nature}.

The paleoclimate perspective is essential because the modern instrumental record provides 
insufficient temporal scope to evaluate climate model performance on centennial-to-millennial 
timescales \citep{ZhouWEA2016, Tierney2020Paleo}. The climate system is far from equilibrium 
within the $\sim$150-year observational period, limiting our ability to constrain equilibrium 
climate sensitivity and assess long-term climate feedbacks \citep{Sherwood2020}. Paleoclimate 
states spanning dramatically different CO$_2$ levels, ice sheet configurations, and ocean 
circulation patterns provide ``out-of-sample'' tests for models developed primarily using 
modern observations \citep{Zhu2021NCC}. For AABW specifically, paleoclimate constraints 
offer the only means to evaluate how formation mechanisms respond to forcing changes 
spanning full glacial-interglacial amplitudes.

\subsection{State of paleoclimate AABW research: proxy records and modeling advances}

\subsubsection{Proxy-based reconstructions of past AABW variability}

Multiple geochemical tracers have been developed to reconstruct past AABW properties and 
circulation pathways. Benthic foraminiferal $\delta^{13}$C has been extensively applied as 
a quasi-conservative water mass tracer, exploiting the distinct isotopic signatures of NADW 
(high $\delta^{13}$C from nutrient-depleted source waters) versus AABW (low $\delta^{13}$C 
from incomplete surface nutrient utilization) \citep{Curry1988, OppoFairbanks1987}. Compilations 
of benthic $\delta^{13}$C from the Atlantic reveal a dramatic restructuring at the LGM, with 
NADW shoaling to intermediate depths ($\sim$2,000~m) and AABW expanding to fill the abyssal 
Atlantic \citep{Curry2005, Hines2021}. However, $\delta^{13}$C is influenced by both circulation 
and biogeochemistry (air-sea gas exchange, biological productivity, respiration), complicating 
interpretation \citep{Eide2017}.

Neodymium isotopes ($\epsilon_{Nd}$) have emerged as a powerful quasi-conservative tracer 
for reconstructing deep water mass geometry \citep{Goldstein2003, Piotrowski2005}. Modern 
observations show NADW characterized by unradiogenic $\epsilon_{Nd}$ values ($\sim$-13), 
whereas AABW and Pacific deep waters display more radiogenic signatures ($\sim$-8 to -7) 
\citep{Lacan2005, Lambelet2016}. High-resolution $\epsilon_{Nd}$ records spanning the last 
glacial cycle demonstrate oscillating NADW and AABW contributions to deep Atlantic ventilation, 
with AABW influence maximized during stadials and Heinrich events \citep{Piotrowski2008, 
Huang2020}. Recent modeling studies incorporating neodymium cycling confirm that $\epsilon_{Nd}$ 
variations primarily reflect changes in NADW versus AABW formation rates and mixing patterns, 
with boundary exchange processes as the dominant Nd source \citep{Gu2019, Poppelmeier2022}.

Radiocarbon-based ventilation ages provide the most direct constraint on deep ocean circulation 
rates. Benthic-planktonic (B-P) $^{14}$C age offsets reveal globally increased deep ocean 
isolation during glacials, with the most extreme values in the deep Pacific and Southern Ocean 
\citep{Broecker1984, Skinner2010}. However, methodological refinements demonstrate that bulk 
B-P ages comprise both circulation age and ``preformed $^{14}$C-age'' arising from incomplete 
atmosphere-ocean equilibration at formation regions---particularly problematic in the sea 
ice-covered Southern Ocean \citep{Koeve2015}. Recent deglacial reconstructions reveal a 
``radiocarbon ventilation seesaw,'' with deep Pacific and Atlantic ventilation ages changing 
in opposite phases, explained by alternating NADW versus AABW production \citep{Skinner2014, 
Skinner2021}. Transient simulations using ideal age tracers demonstrate that true (ideal) 
ventilation age was modestly younger at the LGM compared to present due to stronger AABW 
transport from enhanced brine rejection, reconciling the apparently contradictory radiocarbon 
evidence \citep{Li2024CP}.

Additional proxies provide complementary constraints. Authigenic uranium (aU) records detect 
deep ocean oxygenation changes, with reduced aU accumulation indicating decreased bottom 
water oxygenation during AABW weakening events \citep{Hayes2014, Glasscock2020}. Benthic 
$^{231}$Pa/$^{230}$Th ratios constrain meridional overturning intensity, though interpretation 
is complicated by boundary scavenging effects \citep{Negre2010, Lippold2016}. Benthic 
foraminiferal $\delta^{18}$O and Mg/Ca jointly constrain deep ocean temperature and salinity 
evolution \citep{Adkins2002, Elderfield2012}, revealing that the glacial deep ocean was 
near freezing point globally with the Southern Ocean containing the saltiest deep water 
(37.1~psu) \citep{Adkins2002}.

\subsubsection{Modeling studies of AABW across paleoclimate states}

Paleoclimate modeling has advanced from simplified box models \citep{Toggweiler1999, 
Gildor2001} through intermediate complexity models \citep{Menviel2012, Bouttes2012} to 
comprehensive Earth System Models participating in the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison 
Project (PMIP) \citep{Braconnot2012, Kageyama2017}. Early studies using conceptual models 
identified key mechanisms linking Southern Ocean processes to atmospheric CO$_2$: enhanced 
stratification reducing CO$_2$ outgassing \citep{Francois1997, Toggweiler1999}, equatorward 
wind shifts reducing upwelling of CO$_2$-rich waters \citep{Toggweiler2006}, and expanded 
sea ice capping deep waters \citep{Stephens2000}.

Comprehensive model intercomparisons under PMIP3/CMIP5 revealed substantial inter-model 
spread in simulated glacial ocean circulation changes \citep{Weber2007, Marzocchi2019}. 
Some models show weakened Atlantic overturning at the LGM, while others maintain vigorous 
circulation \citep{Weber2007}. The representation of Antarctic sea ice varies dramatically, 
with PMIP3 models showing September sea ice extent ranging from 10--30$\times10^6$~km$^2$ 
compared to proxy-based estimates of $\sim$17$\times10^6$~km$^2$ \citep{Lhardy2022}. These 
discrepancies propagate to simulated deep ocean ventilation and carbon storage.

Recent advances include transient deglacial simulations that capture temporal evolution 
of circulation changes. The TRACE-21ka simulation demonstrates that AABW transport variations 
primarily control global deep ocean ventilation age, with ages peaking at 1,900--2,200~years 
around 14--12~ka during weakened AABW transport \citep{Liu2009, Li2024CP}. Isotope-enabled 
simulations (e.g., iLOVECLIM, iCESM) now incorporate radiocarbon, stable isotopes, and trace 
elements, enabling direct model-data comparison using the same tracers measured in proxy 
records \citep{Menviel2017, Gu2019, Poppelmeier2022}. These developments allow quantitative 
assessment of whether models capture first-order circulation changes indicated by proxy 
compilations.

Despite progress, fundamental limitations persist. As discussed earlier, most CMIP6 models 
form AABW through open-ocean deep convection rather than realistic shelf processes 
\citep{Heuze2021}. This affects not only the spatial distribution of formation but potentially 
the sensitivity of AABW to climate forcing. Resolution constraints prevent explicit 
representation of critical small-scale processes: coastal polynyas ($\sim$10--100~km), 
dense water cascades down continental slopes, and ice shelf cavity circulation 
\citep{Schmidt2025}. Parameterizations attempt to compensate but introduce additional 
uncertainties and tuning requirements \citep{Dufour2017}.

\subsubsection{Model-data comparison challenges and uncertainties}

Quantitative model-data comparison faces multiple obstacles. Proxy records and model outputs 
represent fundamentally different quantities: proxies measure geochemical tracers integrated 
over specific time windows, whereas models directly simulate physical variables 
\citep{Phipps2013, Evans2013}. Proxy System Models (PSMs) provide a framework for translating 
model output into proxy space, but PSM uncertainties can be substantial \citep{Evans2013, 
Dee2015}. For instance, benthic foraminiferal $\delta^{18}$O reflects both temperature and 
seawater $\delta^{18}$O (itself influenced by salinity, ice volume, and local hydrology), 
requiring multi-proxy approaches or model-derived seawater $\delta^{18}$O fields to isolate 
temperature \citep{Rohling1998}.

Chronological uncertainties pose additional challenges, particularly for integrating records 
across multiple sites. Radiocarbon dating uncertainties of $\pm$100--300~years are typical 
for the last glacial period, with larger uncertainties for older periods or in archives with 
low carbonate content \citep{Reimer2020}. Reservoir age corrections for marine radiocarbon 
introduce further uncertainty, particularly where past reservoir ages differed from modern 
\citep{Skinner2019}. These age uncertainties complicate identification of lead-lag relationships 
and assessment of synchroneity between different regions or climate components.

Spatial coverage remains limited. High-quality proxy records concentrate in specific regions 
(North Atlantic, Southern Ocean sectors) with large data gaps elsewhere. The deep Pacific, 
which contains $\sim$50\% of ocean volume, has relatively sparse coverage \citep{Skinner2019}. 
This spatial heterogeneity challenges global synthesis efforts and means model-data comparisons 
rely heavily on regional patterns that may not represent global-scale changes.

Recent efforts have improved these challenges through coordinated data synthesis initiatives 
(e.g., MARGO for LGM sea surface temperatures \citep{MARGO2009}, LGMNd isotope compilation 
\citep{Piotrowski2012}), standardized model-data comparison metrics \citep{Hargreaves2011, 
Kageyama2021}, and paleoclimate data assimilation techniques that formally combine proxy 
information with model simulations while accounting for respective uncertainties 
\citep{Tierney2020Paleo, Osman2021}. Despite progress, model-data consistency varies 
substantially across variables and regions, with models often underestimating the magnitude 
of reconstructed regional changes \citep{Harrison2012}.

\subsection{Knowledge gaps and research objectives}

Despite substantial progress, several critical gaps constrain our understanding of AABW 
formation mechanisms across paleoclimate states. First, \textbf{the relative importance of 
thermal versus haline forcing in AABW precursor water formation has not been systematically 
quantified across multiple climate states using consistent methodology}. While modern 
observations and reanalysis-driven water mass transformation analyses have illuminated 
contemporary formation mechanisms \citep{Pellichero2018, Bailey2023}, comparable analysis 
across glacial and interglacial climates remains absent. The limited studies that exist 
focus on single climate states or employ different methodological approaches, precluding 
robust inter-period comparison.

Second, \textbf{mechanistic understanding of regional differences in AABW response to climate 
forcing requires further investigation}. Why does the Ross Sea exhibit particularly young 
ventilation ages during the LIG despite other Southern Ocean regions showing slightly older 
ages? What controls the spatial distribution of AABW formation intensity changes between 
glacial and interglacial periods? These regional variations likely reflect complex interactions 
between sea ice dynamics, ice shelf geometry, bathymetry, and atmospheric forcing, but 
systematic analysis linking surface forcing to formation rate changes across source regions 
is lacking.

Third, \textbf{model-simulated ventilation ages have not been comprehensively validated 
against proxy reconstructions across the full spectrum of warm and cold climate states}. 
Most model-data radiocarbon comparisons focus on the LGM and deglaciation \citep{Menviel2017, 
Li2024CP}, with fewer studies examining interglacial periods including the LIG and 
mid-Holocene. Given evidence for distinct AABW behavior during warm versus cold periods 
\citep{Hayes2014, Ferrari2014}, systematic validation across this full range is essential 
for assessing whether models capture first-order circulation physics.

Fourth, \textbf{the implications of model limitations in representing AABW formation processes 
remain poorly quantified}. While it is recognized that most models form AABW through 
open-ocean deep convection rather than shelf overflows \citep{Heuze2021, deLavergne2014}, 
the consequences for paleoclimate applications are unclear. Does incorrect formation 
mechanism compromise the models' ability to simulate AABW's response to forcing? Under 
what circumstances might models still provide useful insights despite this limitation? 
Some evidence suggests relative changes may be more robust than absolute values 
\citep{Menviel2021CP}, but systematic evaluation is lacking.

Finally, \textbf{integrated analysis combining mechanistic process studies, tracer-based 
validation, and systematic comparison across multiple climate states is rare}. Most studies 
focus on single aspects: circulation changes OR carbon cycle implications OR specific 
formation mechanisms. Comprehensive studies that link surface forcing $\rightarrow$ water 
mass transformation $\rightarrow$ AABW properties $\rightarrow$ ventilation changes 
$\rightarrow$ biogeochemical impacts across multiple climate states would provide crucial 
mechanistic insights.

This study addresses these gaps through systematic water mass transformation analysis and 
ventilation age diagnostics across five carefully selected paleoclimate periods spanning 
glacial and interglacial conditions. By decomposing surface buoyancy fluxes into individual 
thermal and haline components, we quantify how the dominant driver of AABW precursor water 
formation shifts between climate states. Ideal age tracer simulations enable comparison 
with radiocarbon-based proxy reconstructions, validating the model's representation of 
circulation changes. While acknowledging that our model, like most climate models, produces 
AABW through open-ocean convection rather than fully realistic shelf processes, we demonstrate 
that comparative analysis across climate states reveals robust mechanistic patterns. These 
results illuminate fundamental controls on deep ocean ventilation and carbon storage across 
glacial-interglacial cycles, providing process-level insights essential for understanding 
past climate variations and projecting future deep ocean changes.

\subsection{Model representation challenges}

Climate models face systematic challenges in representing AABW formation. Comprehensive 
assessment of CMIP6 models reveals that 28 out of 35 models form AABW predominantly through 
open-ocean deep convection rather than realistic shelf overflow processes \citep{Heuze2021}. 
This limitation stems primarily from insufficient horizontal resolution to resolve shelf 
processes, which require approximately 2--4~km resolution \citep{Schmidt2025}. However, 
recent model developments show promising improvements \citep{Mohrmann2021}, and models 
with overflow parameterizations can achieve accurate AABW properties even at coarse resolution 
\citep{Schmidt2025}. Despite these limitations, paleoclimate model studies remain valuable 
when constraints are properly acknowledged, as relative changes in response to forcing may 
be robust even when absolute values contain biases \citep{Menviel2021CP, Zhu2025}.

\subsection{Model description and experimental design}


The model used in this study, AWIESM2, is a state-of-the-art Earth system model developed at the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) \citep{sidorenko2019evaluation}. It consists of an atmospheric component, ECHAM6 \citep{stevens2013atmospheric},  which includes a land-surface component JSBACH representing dynamic vegetation with two types of bare surface and multiple plant functional types \citep{brovkin2009global,reick2013representation,reick2021jsbach}, as well as an ice-ocean model FESOM2 employing a multi-resolution dynamical core based on finite volume formulation \citep{danilov2017finite}. The atmosphere grid applied in the present study is T63L47, which has a global mean spatial resolution of 1.875° with 47 vertical levels.  A spatially-variable resolution is used for the ice-ocean component (Fig. S1), from about 100 km in the open ocean to 25 km over polar areas and 35 km for the equatorial belt and along coastlines. Vertically, there are 46 uneven layers in the ocean. 

% Continue with your methods...
We perform 5 equilibrium simulations, representing 3 interglacial time periods, i.e., pre-industrial (PI), mid-Holocene (MH), and last interglacial (LIG), as well as 2 glacial periods, i.e., Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3).  The initial conditions for the atmosphere in our PI simulation are derived from the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) \citep{roeckner2004atmospheric}. The ocean model is initialized with the  World Ocean Atlas (WOA)  climatological temperature and salinity data for the years 1950-2000 \citep{levitus2010world}. We run the PI simulation for 1,500 model years with dynamic vegetation. The MH and LIG simulations are initialized from the PI run. The boundary conditions are configured following the criteria of PMIP4 \citep{otto2017pmip4}. Orbital parameters are calculated following \citet{berger1977long}, and the greenhouse gas concentrations are taken from multi-archive reconstructions from ice core records and recent measurements of firn air and atmospheric samples \citep{fluckiger2002high,monnin2004evidence,schilt2010glacial,buiron2011taldice,schneider2013reconstruction,kohler2017156}.
The CO$_2$ concentration used in our study is 284.32 ppm for PI, 264.4 ppm for MH, 275 ppm for LIG, 210.5 ppm for MIS3, and 190 ppm for LGM. For LGM and MIS3, we fix the boundary conditions at 21 ka and 38 ka respectively. The topography and ice-sheet properties are derived from the GLAC1D reconstruction  \citep{tarasov2003greenland,tarasov2012data,briggs2014data}. Both LGM and MIS3 experiments are initialized from a previous LGM model study \citep{werner2016glacial}. All of the 4 paleo simulations are integrated for  1,000 model years, with the simulated climate  being in a quasi-equilibrium state for the final 100 model years.

\subsection{Surface buoyancy flux decomposition using xbudget}

To quantify the individual contributions of different physical processes to surface buoyancy forcing, we employ the xbudget Python package (https://github.com/hdrake/xbudget), which provides model-agnostic tools for analyzing finite-volume ocean model budgets \citep{xbudget2024}. The xbudget framework, built on xarray and xgcm, enables systematic decomposition of tracer budgets into individual forcing terms while maintaining numerical consistency with the underlying model's finite-volume discretization.

We compute surface density tendency budgets for three tracers (mass, heat, and salt) following the MOM6 surface budget configuration. For each experiment, monthly climatological output from FESOM2 is first regridded from the unstructured mesh to a regular 0.5°×0.5° latitude-longitude grid using pyfesom2's nearest-neighbor interpolation with 80-km search radius. ECHAM6 surface fluxes (shortwave radiation var95, longwave radiation var92, latent heat var111, sensible heat var120) are interpolated to the ocean grid using scipy's griddata method. Freshwater fluxes include precipitation (prlq), snowfall (prsn), evaporation (evs), river runoff (friver), and sea ice melt/formation (fsitherm), with sea ice freshwater flux assumed to have salinity S$_{ice}$ = 5~psu.

The xbudget analysis decomposes surface density tendency into:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}\bigg|_{\text{surface}} = \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}\bigg|_{\text{mass}} + \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}\bigg|_{\text{heat}} + \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}\bigg|_{\text{salt}}
\end{equation}

For heat flux decomposition, we run xbudget five times with different heat flux configurations (total, shortwave only, longwave only, latent heat only, sensible heat only), setting non-selected components to zero in each run. This isolates the individual contribution of each heat flux component to surface density tendency. The salt budget similarly decomposes freshwater forcing into individual precipitation, evaporation, sea ice, runoff, and snowfall contributions. All budget terms are output in units consistent with FESOM2's tracer equations: heat (W~m$^{-2}$), mass (kg~m$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$), and salt (psu~s$^{-1}$).

We analyze both austral winter (JJA: June-July-August) and summer (DJF: December-January-February) seasonal means to assess the year-round persistence of identified mechanisms. Sea ice masks are applied to brine rejection terms, setting them to zero where monthly sea ice concentration falls below threshold (a$_{\text{ice}}$ = 0). Spatial patterns are smoothed using a Gaussian filter ($\sigma$ = 1.5 grid points) to reduce small-scale noise while preserving large-scale structure.

\subsection{Water mass transformation analysis using xwmt}

Water mass transformation (WMT) analysis provides a quantitative framework for diagnosing formation rates of water masses in density coordinates, following the approach of \citet{Walin1982} and \citet{Groeskamp2019}. We employ the xwmt Python package (https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/xwmt), an xarray-based framework developed at NOAA-GFDL specifically designed for calculating water mass transformations in a computationally efficient manner \citep{xwmt2024}.

The xwmt package implements the Walin water mass transformation framework, which relates surface buoyancy fluxes to the formation rate of water masses in density space. For a given density class $\sigma$, the transformation rate $G(\sigma)$ represents the volume flux (in Sverdrups, 1~Sv = 10$^6$~m$^3$~s$^{-1}$) across that density surface due to surface forcing. Positive $G(\sigma)$ indicates water becoming denser through surface buoyancy loss, while negative $G(\sigma)$ indicates lightening through buoyancy gain.

The total transformation is decomposed into contributions from individual forcing components:
\begin{equation}
G_{\text{total}}(\sigma) = G_{\text{heat}}(\sigma) + G_{\text{salt}}(\sigma)
\end{equation}
where $G_{\text{heat}}$ represents transformation due to surface heat fluxes and $G_{\text{salt}}$ captures haline forcing from freshwater fluxes. The salt component is further decomposed into sea ice contributions (brine rejection and melt) and other freshwater sources (precipitation, evaporation, runoff, snowfall).

For each paleoclimate experiment, we compute WMT in four key Southern Ocean regions: (1) Southern Ocean (south of 60°S), (2) Ross Sea (180°W--60°W), (3) Weddell Sea (60°W--79°E), and (4) Ad\'elie Land (79°E--180°E). These regions encompass the primary AABW formation sites and allow regional comparison of formation mechanisms. Regional transformations are calculated by applying spatial masks to the areacello-weighted surface forcing fields before integration.

The computational workflow integrates xbudget and xwmt seamlessly. After xbudget decomposes surface forcing into individual heat and salt components (Section 2.2), these decomposed budgets are passed directly to xwmt's WaterMassTransformations class. The xwmt framework constructs an xgcm Grid object that handles metric terms (cell areas) and boundary conditions for proper spatial integration. Transformations are computed in $\sigma_2$ (potential density referenced to 2000~dbar) space using 0.1~kg/m$^3$ bins spanning $\sigma_2$ = 0--40~kg/m$^3$, with dense water formation ($\sigma_2$ $>$ 36.5~kg/m$^3$) as the primary focus.

We analyze both annual mean and austral winter (JJA) transformation rates, as AABW formation exhibits strong seasonal modulation. Winter transformations typically exceed annual means by factors of 2--3 due to enhanced convection and sea ice formation during the cold season. The xwmt package's lazy evaluation strategy (leveraging Dask) enables efficient processing of high-resolution unstructured mesh data across multiple experiments and configurations without exceeding memory constraints.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Large-scale features of the Southern Ocean}

The simulated JJA (austral winter) climate patterns reveal distinct characteristics across the five paleoclimate states (Fig.~1--3). SST anomalies relative to PI exhibit strong regional contrasts: LIG shows pronounced warming ($>$2°C) in the Bellingshausen-Amundsen Seas, while LGM and MIS3 display basin-wide cooling exceeding 5°C. SSS anomalies follow similar spatial patterns, with LIG freshening and glacial periods showing widespread salinification (up to 2~psu) driven by expanded sea ice. Density ($\sigma_2$) changes reflect combined thermal and haline effects, with glacial periods exhibiting substantially denser surface waters ($\Delta\rho >$~0.6~kg/m$^3$) particularly in the Atlantic and Indian sectors.

Sea ice extent and MLD exhibit the most dramatic inter-period differences (Fig.~2). Glacial simulations show circumpolar sea ice coverage extending to $\sim$50°S, while LIG displays reduced ice extent compared to PI, particularly in the Ross and Weddell Seas. Winter MLD reaches 200--400~m in PI/MH/LIG polynyas but exceeds 500~m in glacial Atlantic sector, consistent with enhanced convection.

Wind patterns reveal systematic shifts (Fig.~3). The westerly wind maximum strengthens and shifts poleward in LIG, generating positive wind speed anomalies south of 55°S. Conversely, LGM and MIS3 exhibit equatorward-shifted, weakened westerlies. Wind stress anomalies mirror these patterns, with LIG showing enhanced Southern Ocean wind stress ($\Delta\tau >$~0.04~N/m$^2$) in the 50--60°S band, while glacial periods display widespread stress reduction. These atmospheric circulation changes directly modulate Ekman upwelling and polynya ventilation efficiency.

\subsection{Surface buoyancy flux decomposition}

To understand the physical processes driving water mass transformation, we decompose surface buoyancy fluxes into their individual heat and freshwater components using the xbudget framework (Section 2.3). This analysis isolates how different atmospheric and oceanic processes contribute to surface density changes that ultimately drive AABW formation.

\subsubsection{Heat flux patterns and the sea ice insulation paradox}

During the preindustrial period (Fig.~4a,f,k), the Southern Ocean experiences strong circumpolar heat loss to the atmosphere, with total heat flux reaching $-$0.2 to $-$0.1~kJ~s$^{-1}$~m$^{-2}$ in austral winter (JJA). This cooling is dominated by turbulent heat fluxes (latent and sensible heat; Fig.~4k) rather than radiative components (shortwave and longwave; Fig.~4f), reflecting the importance of ocean-atmosphere turbulent exchange in driving surface densification. The strongest heat loss occurs in the Weddell and Ross Seas and along the coastal polynya regions where persistent offshore winds expose ocean surfaces to frigid atmospheric conditions.

Interglacial climate anomalies (MH, LIG) show minimal heat flux changes in most regions, with MH exhibiting nearly neutral anomalies (Fig.~4b,g,l) and LIG displaying localized warming in the Ross Sea sector (reduced heat loss of $\sim$0.1~kJ~s$^{-1}$~m$^{-2}$; Fig.~4c). This Ross Sea anomaly reflects reduced sea ice coverage during LIG, allowing enhanced ocean-atmosphere heat exchange in a region that remains ice-covered during PI winter.

Glacial periods (LGM, MIS3) reveal a counterintuitive phenomenon: despite substantially colder atmospheric temperatures, the ocean experiences \textit{reduced} heat loss compared to PI (Fig.~4d,e). Heat flux anomalies of +0.1 to +0.2~kJ~s$^{-1}$~m$^{-2}$ (blue colors indicating less cooling) appear throughout the Southern Ocean, with both radiative (Fig.~4i,j) and turbulent (Fig.~4n,o) components contributing to this effect. Critically, the turbulent flux reduction \textit{exceeds} the radiative reduction, indicating that the physical mechanism involves blocking ocean-atmosphere exchange rather than changes in radiative forcing alone.

This \textbf{sea ice insulation paradox}---warmer ocean surfaces (less heat loss) despite colder air---arises from expanded glacial sea ice acting as a thermal insulating lid. The ice cover prevents turbulent heat exchange (evaporation and sensible heat loss) more effectively than it blocks radiation, fundamentally altering the surface energy balance. During summer (DJF; Fig.~5), this insulation effect weakens but persists in the glacial ice-covered sectors, demonstrating that sea ice's thermal role operates year-round albeit with seasonal modulation. The summer patterns (Fig.~5) show reduced anomaly magnitudes but similar spatial structures, confirming that the insulation mechanism is intrinsic to ice cover rather than a winter-only phenomenon.

\subsubsection{Freshwater flux patterns and coastal brine intensification}

Surface freshwater fluxes, which drive haline forcing of density, exhibit starkly different patterns (Fig.~6--7). The PI baseline (Fig.~6a,f,k) shows modest total freshwater fluxes, with coastal regions experiencing brine rejection during sea ice formation (red colors in Fig.~6f indicating surface salinification) and offshore zones receiving freshwater from ice melt (blue colors). Other freshwater sources (precipitation, evaporation, runoff, snowfall; Fig.~6k) contribute weak net effects in winter.

Glacial periods transform this pattern dramatically. Total freshwater flux anomalies (Fig.~6d,e) reveal strong positive values (blue: net freshwater gain) along the Antarctic coast, but this bulk signal masks opposing contributions from different components. The sea ice component (Fig.~6i,j) shows \textit{intensified} coastal brine rejection (red: +0.0002~kg~s$^{-1}$~m$^{-2}$) coinciding with \textit{reduced} offshore ice melt (blue: $-$0.0002~kg~s$^{-1}$~m$^{-2}$). This spatial partitioning reflects expanded sea ice extent: persistent coastal polynyas maintain vigorous ice production and brine rejection, while the expanded offshore ice pack reduces summer melting.

The sea ice freshwater component dominates other freshwater sources (Fig.~6n,o), which show complex but weaker patterns related to precipitation and evaporation changes. During summer (DJF; Fig.~7), the seasonal cycle reverses completely: PI exhibits net freshwater input from ice melt (Fig.~7f: negative salt tendency, blue colors indicating ocean freshening), transitioning from winter's brine rejection to summer's freshwater release. Glacial anomalies (Fig.~7i,j) reveal \textit{reduced} summer melt compared to PI---less freshwater release during the melt season. This asymmetry between enhanced winter brine production (Fig.~6i,j: positive anomaly) and suppressed summer freshwater release (Fig.~7i,j: negative anomaly meaning less melt) creates a net annual haline forcing that strengthens glacial AABW formation. The expanded ice pack acts as a freshwater reservoir, capturing more salt during winter freezing while releasing less freshwater during summer melting.

\subsubsection{Mechanistic linkage to water mass transformation}

These surface flux decompositions illuminate \textbf{sea ice's dual role} in governing AABW formation across climate states. First, expanded glacial sea ice \textit{insulates} the bulk ocean surface from atmospheric heat loss, reducing area-integrated thermal forcing. This explains why glacial WMT (Section 3.3) shifts to higher density classes---the regions that \textit{do} experience cooling (primarily coastal polynyas) undergo more intense densification precisely because they are the few locations where ocean-atmosphere exchange persists. Second, sea ice \textit{concentrates} brine rejection in these persistent coastal polynyas, enhancing haline forcing in the critical AABW formation regions.

This flux partitioning explains the WMT mechanism shift documented in Section 3.3: interglacial thermal dominance (85--90\% heat flux contribution) transitions to glacial haline enhancement (25--30\% sea ice contribution). Critically, reduced area-integrated heat loss does \textit{not} imply reduced AABW formation; instead, formation becomes concentrated in fewer, more vigorous polynya regions where combined thermal and haline forcing drives transformation to exceptionally dense surface waters ($\sigma_2$ = 37.0--37.5~kg/m$^3$) capable of penetrating to abyssal depths. The resulting denser source waters (0.3--0.5~kg/m$^3$ denser than interglacial values) sink more readily and resist mixing with overlying layers, establishing the stratification that underlies glacial deep ocean isolation and ventilation age increases (Section 3.4).

\subsection{Water mass transformation analysis}

Water mass transformation (WMT) analysis reveals a fundamental shift in AABW precursor water formation mechanisms between interglacial and glacial climate states (Fig.~8--9). We focus on transformation rates in the dense water range ($\sigma_2$ $>$ 36.5~kg/m$^3$), where AABW precursor waters form through surface buoyancy loss.

\subsubsection{Interglacial periods: heat flux dominance}

During interglacial periods (PI/MH/LIG), heat loss drives AABW precursor water formation across all four Southern Ocean regions. In the Southern Ocean sector during austral winter (Fig.~9, top row), total WMT exhibits strong positive peaks at $\sigma_2$ = 36.6--36.8~kg/m$^3$ reaching 40--60~Sv, with total heat flux (red line) closely tracking the WMT magnitude and shape. Sea ice freshwater contribution (teal dashed) remains modest (peak $<$10~Sv), while other freshwater fluxes (blue dashed) act to oppose densification through net precipitation. This thermal dominance persists in regional hotspots: the Ross Sea shows winter WMT peaks of 30--40~Sv driven almost entirely by heat loss, while the Weddell Sea exhibits 25--35~Sv transformation with similar thermal control. Critically, the Adélie Land sector---a known polynya region---displays the clearest heat-flux-driven signature, with 20~Sv winter transformation at $\sigma_2$ = 36.7~kg/m$^3$ where heat flux accounts for $>$90\% of total WMT.

Annual mean patterns (Fig.~8) show reduced but persistent thermal forcing, with Southern Ocean WMT of 10--15~Sv at dense water classes. The summer reversal (negative WMT from warming and ice melt) partially compensates winter gains, explaining the annual-winter amplitude difference. Notably, LIG exhibits slightly enhanced heat-driven transformation compared to PI/MH in the Ross Sea, consistent with reduced sea ice coverage allowing greater ocean-atmosphere heat exchange.

\subsubsection{Glacial periods: intensified sea ice forcing}

Glacial climates (LGM/MIS3) show dramatically different formation mechanisms. Winter WMT intensifies substantially, with Southern Ocean peaks exceeding 60~Sv at higher density classes ($\sigma_2$ = 37.0--37.5~kg/m$^3$; Fig.~9). However, the relative importance of forcing components shifts: sea ice freshwater flux (teal) strengthens to 15--20~Sv, constituting 25--30\% of total transformation---double the interglacial proportion. This reflects expanded sea ice extent and enhanced brine rejection in coastal polynyas. Heat flux remains the dominant term but operates at colder temperatures and denser isopycnals, consistent with glacial boundary conditions.

Regional heterogeneity becomes pronounced. The Weddell Sea exhibits the strongest glacial intensification, with winter WMT reaching 30~Sv at $\sigma_2$ = 37.2~kg/m$^3$ where sea ice brine rejection contributes $\sim$30\%. The Ross Sea shows more modest enhancement (20--25~Sv), with thermal forcing still dominant but shifted to denser classes. Strikingly, the Adélie sector maintains strong transformation (15~Sv) despite glacial conditions, suggesting persistent polynya activity even with expanded sea ice.

\subsubsection{Mechanistic interpretation}

These WMT patterns illuminate the physical processes governing AABW precursor water formation across climate states. During interglacials, open-ocean and polynya regions experience intense radiative and turbulent heat loss to the cold atmosphere, directly densifying surface waters through cooling. The relatively limited sea ice extent means brine rejection contributes secondarily. In contrast, glacial expanded sea ice coverage has dual effects: (1) insulating much of the ocean surface from atmospheric heat loss, reducing area-integrated thermal transformation; but (2) concentrating formation in persistent coastal polynyas where combined thermal forcing and intense sea ice production drive transformation of surface waters to exceptionally dense classes ($\sigma_2$ $>$ 37~kg/m$^3$) capable of penetrating to abyssal depths.

The shift to higher-density transformation during glacials (0.3--0.5~kg/m$^3$ denser than interglacials) has profound implications for AABW properties and ventilation timescales. Denser source waters sink more readily, spread farther, and resist mixing with overlying layers---potentially explaining the 1500-year ventilation age increases documented in Section 3.4. However, this must be reconciled with proxy evidence for reduced glacial AABW transport \citep{Skinner2017, Ferrari2014}: our results suggest formation mechanism shifts (thermal $\rightarrow$ haline-enhanced) rather than simple "more/less" AABW, with implications for water mass properties and biogeochemical cycling.

\subsection{Ventilation age simulations}

Ideal age distributions at 3900~m depth reveal fundamental restructuring of abyssal ventilation across climate states (Fig.~10). Interglacial periods (PI/MH/LIG) exhibit relatively young ages (0--500~yr) in the Atlantic and Indian sectors, with oldest waters ($>$1000~yr) confined to the Pacific. Glacial periods show dramatically different patterns: LGM and MIS3 ages exceed 1500~yr throughout the Atlantic and Indian basins, with Pacific ages reaching 2000--2500~yr. This represents a global $\sim$1500-year increase in deep ocean isolation, consistent with radiocarbon proxy reconstructions \citep{Skinner2017}.

Regional heterogeneity is pronounced (Fig.~11). LIG anomalies reveal younger-than-PI ages (up to $-$150~yr) in the Ross Sea sector, attributed to reduced sea ice coverage and enhanced thermal forcing. In contrast, the Weddell Sea shows modest age increases during LIG. MH exhibits minimal age changes relative to PI, indicating similar AABW formation rates. Glacial anomalies are spatially coherent: LGM and MIS3 display pervasive age increases of 400--1500~yr across all basins, with maximum values in the deep Pacific where sluggish circulation compounds the aging effect.

Vertical age profiles quantify basin-specific ventilation changes (Fig.~12). In the Atlantic, glacial ages increase systematically with depth, reaching 1500--2000~yr at 4000~m compared to 500--750~yr in interglacials. The Indian Ocean shows intermediate behavior. Most striking is the Pacific, where glacial ages exceed 2500~yr below 3000~m---a tripling relative to PI. Age anomaly profiles (Fig.~13) isolate climate-driven changes: LIG shows slight freshening throughout the water column in the Atlantic ($-$75 to $-$150~yr), while LGM/MIS3 exhibit depth-increasing anomalies reaching $+$1500~yr in the deep Pacific. These patterns reflect reduced AABW formation and enhanced stratification under glacial boundary conditions.

\subsection{Southern Annular Mode influence on AABW formation}

The Southern Annular Mode (SAM)---the dominant mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics---exerts strong control on surface buoyancy forcing and thus AABW formation across all climate states. To quantify SAM's role, we perform composite analysis comparing high-SAM versus low-SAM years (defined as exceeding $\pm$1$\sigma$ from climatological mean) using 100-year monthly simulations for each paleoclimate period.

\subsubsection{SAM modulation of surface heat fluxes}

Heat flux composite analysis reveals that positive SAM phases systematically enhance ocean heat loss across the Southern Ocean (Fig.~14). During austral winter (JJA), high-SAM conditions drive anomalous cooling exceeding 15~W/m$^2$ in the circumpolar 50--65°S band across all climate states. This enhanced heat loss reflects strengthened and poleward-shifted westerly winds during positive SAM, which increase turbulent heat fluxes (latent and sensible) through enhanced ocean-atmosphere exchange. Decomposition into components shows that turbulent fluxes (sensible + latent heat; row 3) contribute 60--70\% of the total heat flux anomaly, with radiative components (longwave + shortwave; row 2) providing the remaining 30--40\%.

Climate state dependency is pronounced. Interglacial periods (PI/MH/LIG) exhibit spatially coherent positive heat flux anomalies throughout the ice-free Southern Ocean, with maximum values in the Atlantic and Indian sectors where open water permits direct atmosphere-ocean coupling. In contrast, glacial periods (LGM/MIS3) show reduced SAM-driven heat flux variability due to expanded sea ice insulation that dampens atmosphere-ocean exchange. The heat flux anomaly magnitude decreases by approximately 40\% during glacials compared to interglacials, demonstrating that sea ice extent fundamentally modulates SAM's capacity to influence surface buoyancy forcing.

Regional patterns reflect local oceanographic conditions. The Ross Sea exhibits the strongest SAM sensitivity during interglacials, with heat flux anomalies exceeding 20~W/m$^2$ during high-SAM phases---consistent with this region's exposure to westerly wind variability and reduced sea ice buffering during warm periods. The Weddell Sea shows more muted response due to persistent coastal polynyas that maintain atmosphere-ocean coupling even during low-SAM conditions. This regional heterogeneity implies that SAM-driven AABW formation changes concentrate in specific sectors rather than occurring uniformly around Antarctica.

\subsubsection{SAM modulation of freshwater fluxes}

Freshwater flux composites demonstrate that SAM primarily influences AABW formation through sea ice processes rather than direct precipitation-evaporation changes (Fig.~15). Total freshwater flux anomalies (row 1) show complex dipole patterns with positive SAM driving freshwater loss (ocean salinification) in coastal regions coinciding with freshwater gain offshore. Decomposition reveals that this pattern arises predominantly from sea ice dynamics (row 2): high-SAM conditions enhance offshore sea ice transport and melting while intensifying coastal polynya brine rejection through strengthened katabatic winds.

The sea ice freshwater component dominates other sources (precipitation, evaporation, runoff; row 3) by factors of 3--5 in all climate states, confirming that SAM-driven AABW variability operates primarily through haline forcing via sea ice redistribution. Glacial periods exhibit amplified sea ice responses: LGM and MIS3 show freshwater flux anomalies exceeding 1.0~mm/day in coastal regions during high-SAM phases, compared to 0.5--0.7~mm/day in interglacials. This glacial amplification reflects expanded baseline sea ice coverage providing larger reservoir for SAM-driven redistribution.

Seasonal dependence is critical. Winter composites (JJA) show strongest signals when sea ice formation peaks, whereas summer patterns (not shown) exhibit reversed but weaker anomalies associated with melt season dynamics. The asymmetry between winter intensification and summer weakening creates net annual haline forcing that persists beyond individual SAM events, potentially influencing AABW properties on multi-year timescales through preconditioning of shelf water density.

\subsubsection{SAM impact on water mass transformation}

Water mass transformation composites quantify how SAM-driven surface flux changes translate to AABW formation rate variability (Fig.~16). High-SAM conditions systematically enhance transformation across all density classes and climate states, with maximum impacts in the dense water range ($\sigma_2$ $>$ 36.5~kg/m$^3$) critical for AABW precursor formation. During interglacial winters, Southern Ocean WMT increases by 5--8~Sv at $\sigma_2$ = 36.6--36.8~kg/m$^3$ during high-SAM versus low-SAM phases, representing 15--20\% modulation of baseline formation rates.

Regional WMT responses reveal mechanistic insights. The Ross Sea exhibits strongest SAM sensitivity (row 2), with high-SAM enhancing WMT by 3--4~Sv---directly consistent with this region's pronounced heat flux response (Fig.~14). The Weddell Sea (row 3) shows more modest WMT changes (1--2~Sv) despite comparable surface flux anomalies, suggesting that local bathymetry and circulation patterns buffer the translation of surface forcing to net transformation. Adélie Land (row 4) demonstrates intermediate sensitivity, with SAM-driven WMT changes concentrated at slightly higher densities ($\sigma_2$ = 36.7--36.9~kg/m$^3$) reflecting this region's colder baseline conditions.

Climate state comparison illuminates how background conditions modulate SAM influence. Glacial periods show shifted WMT anomalies toward higher density classes ($\sigma_2$ = 37.0--37.5~kg/m$^3$), consistent with colder source waters and enhanced stratification. However, the \textit{relative} WMT sensitivity to SAM (percentage change) remains similar across climate states---approximately 15--20\% modulation---indicating that SAM exerts proportional influence regardless of baseline formation intensity. This suggests that SAM-AABW teleconnections represent fundamental atmosphere-ocean coupling that persists across glacial-interglacial cycles.

Decomposition by forcing component shows that SAM-driven WMT changes arise from combined thermal and haline contributions with climate-dependent partitioning. During interglacials, enhanced heat loss contributes 70--80\% of total WMT increase during high-SAM, with sea ice brine rejection providing 20--30\%. Glacial periods shift this balance toward 60--65\% thermal and 35--40\% haline, reflecting sea ice's amplified role in glacial AABW formation mechanisms (Section 3.3). The multi-component forcing underscores that SAM influences AABW through integrated atmosphere-ocean-sea ice coupling rather than single-process control.

\subsubsection{Implications for AABW variability and predictability}

These SAM composite results provide mechanistic basis for understanding observed decadal AABW variability. Recent observations document 30\% reduction in Weddell Sea AABW formation since 1992 linked to wind-driven sea ice decline \citep{Zhou2023}, while Ross Sea exhibited recovery during 2015--2019 from positive SAM combined with El Niño forcing \citep{Silvano2020}. Our analysis demonstrates that such SAM-driven changes operate consistently across all climate states, with high-SAM systematically enhancing formation through combined heat loss and sea ice intensification.

The persistent SAM-AABW relationship across glacial-interglacial cycles implies potential for paleoclimate proxy development. If SAM variability influences formation rates by 15--20\% on multi-year timescales, and formation changes propagate to deep ocean tracer signatures, then high-resolution sediment core records from AABW formation regions might preserve SAM-frequency variability. Existing radiocarbon and benthic isotope records rarely achieve sub-centennial resolution, but emerging techniques (e.g., paleointensity-assisted chronologies, annual-layer counting in high-accumulation sites) could enable SAM reconstruction extending beyond instrumental period.

Furthermore, climate models' ability to capture SAM-AABW coupling provides validation metric for model physics. Models that correctly simulate SAM-driven surface flux anomalies and their translation to WMT changes demonstrate realistic representation of atmosphere-ocean-sea ice interactions critical for projecting future AABW response to Southern Hemisphere climate change. Our results establish quantitative benchmarks (15--20\% WMT modulation, 70--80\% thermal contribution in interglacials shifting to 60--65\% in glacials) against which model performance can be assessed.

\section{Discussion}

Our systematic water mass transformation analysis across five paleoclimate states reveals fundamental mechanisms governing AABW formation response to climate forcing and provides insights into deep ocean ventilation changes that controlled past carbon storage. Here we synthesize our findings within the broader context of observational constraints, proxy reconstructions, and theoretical understanding, while carefully addressing model limitations and their implications for interpreting results.

\subsection{Mechanism-based insights despite model representation limitations}

Climate models face well-documented challenges in representing AABW formation processes. As discussed in Section 1.6, most CMIP6 models---including AWI-ESM---form AABW predominantly through open-ocean deep convection rather than realistic shelf overflow processes \citep{Heuze2021, deLavergne2014}. This limitation stems from insufficient horizontal resolution to resolve shelf processes, which require approximately 2--4~km resolution \citep{Schmidt2025}. The absence of explicit dense water cascades and polynya dynamics introduces systematic biases in formation location, seasonality, and potentially sensitivity to forcing.

However, recent advances in paleoclimate science demonstrate that \textbf{models with known biases can still provide valuable mechanistic insights when their limitations are properly acknowledged and analysis focuses on process understanding rather than precise quantification} \citep{Zhu2021NCC}. The paleoclimate record provides ``out-of-sample'' tests for climate models under conditions of substantial CO$_2$ change, allowing evaluation of fundamental physics and feedbacks that operate on centennial-plus timescales inaccessible to the instrumental record \citep{Tierney2020Paleo}. Critically, \citet{Zhu2021NCC} emphasize that paleoclimate data represent complementary constraints to modern observations, with the combination of both reducing potential model biases in future projections. Similarly, recent analysis shows that CMIP6/PMIP4 ensemble means successfully simulate global mean surface temperatures across multiple paleoclimate periods, with paleoclimate data identifying and correcting specific parameterization issues---for example, excessive climate sensitivity in CESM2 was diagnosed and remedied through paleoclimate evaluation revealing cloud parameterization problems.

\textbf{Our analysis strategy explicitly accounts for model limitations through comparative mechanism diagnosis rather than absolute formation rate quantification.} We focus on three aspects where mechanistic insights remain robust despite open-ocean convection biases:

\textbf{(1) Relative changes in forcing mechanisms across climate states.} While absolute WMT magnitudes may differ from observations, the \textit{shift} from heat-flux dominance (85--90\% contribution) during interglacials to enhanced haline forcing (25--30\% sea ice contribution) during glacials reflects fundamental thermodynamic responses to boundary condition changes. This mechanism transition---thermal cooling in ice-free regions versus brine rejection in ice-covered polynya-like areas---operates regardless of whether formation occurs via shelf overflow or open-ocean convection. The physics of surface buoyancy flux partitioning under different sea ice regimes is robust across formation pathways.

\textbf{(2) Sea ice's dual role in modulating surface forcing.} Our decomposition reveals that glacial sea ice expansion simultaneously (a) insulates the bulk ocean surface from atmospheric heat loss and (b) concentrates brine rejection in localized formation regions. This dual thermal-insulation and haline-intensification mechanism represents fundamental sea ice physics captured even in models with imperfect formation geography. Recent observational studies confirm this dual role: expanded Weddell Sea ice reduces area-integrated ocean heat loss while coastal polynyas maintain intense brine rejection \citep{Bailey2023}, and interannual sea ice variability drives 30\% changes in AABW formation through combined thermal and haline pathways \citep{Zhou2023}.

\textbf{(3) Ventilation age response to circulation changes.} Ideal age distributions integrate the cumulative effect of formation rate changes, transport pathways, and mixing---the age increase of $\sim$1500~yr during glacials primarily reflects reduced formation and enhanced stratification rather than specific formation mechanism details. Model-data radiocarbon comparison (Section 4.2) demonstrates consistency with proxy constraints despite formation location biases, suggesting that basin-scale ventilation response is less sensitive to sub-grid-scale formation processes than might be expected.

This approach aligns with emerging best practices in paleoclimate modeling. Regional climate model studies acknowledge that ``model biases, either from regional climate models themselves or inherited from the driving global model, usually remain'' but emphasize that relative changes and process understanding retain value \citep{Fallah2016}. Similarly, recent assessments emphasize that paleoclimates provide essential tests for latest-generation climate models precisely because models developed primarily from modern observations require out-of-sample validation to identify hidden biases \citep{Zhu2021NCC}. Our focus on \textit{mechanisms}---how thermal versus haline forcing shifts with sea ice coverage, how stratification responds to source water density changes---rather than precise formation rates aligns with this paradigm of extracting robust insights from imperfect models.

\subsection{Comparison with geological proxy reconstructions}

Our simulated ventilation age changes across paleoclimate states can be directly compared with multiple independent geochemical proxy constraints, providing validation of model-diagnosed circulation changes despite formation mechanism limitations discussed above.

\subsubsection{Radiocarbon-based ventilation ages}

Benthic-planktonic $^{14}$C age offsets from sediment cores reveal that glacial deep ocean radiocarbon ages increased globally, with the strongest signals in the Pacific and Southern Ocean \citep{Skinner2010, Skinner2017}. Our simulated LGM ideal age increase of $\sim$1500~yr at 3900~m depth (Fig.~10--11) compares favorably with radiocarbon-derived estimates: \citet{Skinner2017} report that glacial deep ocean $^{14}$C-ventilation ages increased by approximately 689$\pm$53~$^{14}$C-yr compared to the Holocene, with southern-sourced abyssal waters particularly isolated. However, direct comparison requires careful interpretation because benthic-planktonic $^{14}$C ages comprise both true circulation age and ``preformed $^{14}$C-age'' arising from incomplete atmosphere-ocean equilibration at formation regions \citep{Koeve2015}. The sea ice-covered glacial Southern Ocean likely experienced substantial surface reservoir age increases (up to several hundred years), inflating apparent ventilation ages \citep{Skinner2019}.

Recent high-resolution studies provide more nuanced constraints. \citet{Li2024CP} used transient deglacial simulations with both radiocarbon and ideal age tracers to demonstrate that \textit{true} (ideal) ventilation age peaked around 14--12~ka during weakened AABW transport, reaching 1900--2200~years---substantially older than LGM values. This apparent paradox---younger ideal age at LGM despite older radiocarbon age---reflects that enhanced glacial brine rejection drove stronger AABW transport that partially compensated for expanded sea ice insulation effects. Our results support this interpretation: glacial WMT shifts to higher density classes ($\sigma_2$ = 37.0--37.5~kg/m$^3$ versus 36.6--36.8~kg/m$^3$), producing denser source waters that sink more readily despite reduced area-integrated heat loss.

The most recent work further refines understanding. A 2025 \textit{Nature Communications} study demonstrates that reduced AABW overturning during early deglaciation produced the ``radiocarbon ventilation seesaw'' between Atlantic and Pacific basins, with AABW weakening causing Atlantic ventilation age increases while Pacific ages decreased due to compensating NADW changes. Our regional age distributions (Fig.~11--13) capture similar basin-specific responses: LGM shows maximum age increases in the deep Pacific (+1500~yr) where remoteness from formation regions amplifies circulation slowdown effects, while the Atlantic exhibits more modest increases (+800~yr) due to proximity to both NADW and AABW sources.

\subsubsection{Neodymium isotopes and water mass geometry}

Neodymium isotopes ($\epsilon_{Nd}$) provide complementary constraints on deep water mass geometry that are less affected by reservoir age complications. Modern AABW displays radiogenic $\epsilon_{Nd}$ signatures ($\sim$-8 to -7) distinct from unradiogenic NADW ($\sim$-13), allowing reconstruction of relative contributions \citep{Lambelet2016}. Compilation of benthic foraminiferal $\epsilon_{Nd}$ across glacial-interglacial cycles reveals oscillating NADW versus AABW influence, with AABW maximized during stadials \citep{Piotrowski2008, Huang2020}.

While our model does not include explicit neodymium cycling, our simulated circulation changes imply corresponding $\epsilon_{Nd}$ variations that can be qualitatively assessed. During LGM, our enhanced AABW formation intensity in the dense water classes combined with increased ventilation ages suggests expanded AABW volume filling the abyssal Atlantic---consistent with $\epsilon_{Nd}$ evidence for NADW shoaling to $\sim$2000~m and AABW expansion \citep{Curry2005, Hines2021}. The regional heterogeneity we diagnose (strong Weddell enhancement, modest Ross response; Section 3.3) aligns with sediment core evidence showing Atlantic sector dominance of glacial AABW export \citep{Piotrowski2005}.

Recent modeling studies incorporating neodymium cycling confirm that $\epsilon_{Nd}$ variations primarily track NADW versus AABW formation rate changes rather than boundary exchange artifacts \citep{Gu2019, Poppelmeier2022}, validating use of $\epsilon_{Nd}$ for circulation reconstruction. Our mechanism diagnosis---that glacial sea ice drives the thermal-to-haline shift producing denser AABW---provides process-level explanation for proxy-observed circulation restructuring. Specifically, the denser glacial source waters (0.3--0.5~kg/m$^3$ increase) we diagnose would propagate farther and resist mixing more effectively, potentially explaining $\epsilon_{Nd}$ evidence for expanded glacial AABW footprint \citep{Hines2021}.

\subsubsection{Benthic carbon isotopes and respired carbon storage}

Benthic foraminiferal $\delta^{13}$C distributions reveal that the glacial deep ocean stored substantially more respired carbon, with low $\delta^{13}$C values indicating nutrient- and CO$_2$-rich waters \citep{Curry1988, OppoFairbanks1987}. Atlantic $\delta^{13}$C compilations show dramatic restructuring at LGM, with a strong vertical gradient consistent with shoaled NADW and expanded nutrient-rich AABW \citep{Curry2005}. Our ventilation age results directly support this carbon storage mechanism: 1500-year age increases imply prolonged isolation from atmospheric CO$_2$ exchange, allowing accumulation of respired carbon from remineralization of sinking organic matter. Combined with enhanced stratification from denser source waters, this creates conditions for efficient deep ocean carbon sequestration potentially explaining 50--80~ppm of glacial-interglacial CO$_2$ variations \citep{Skinner2017, Ferrari2014}.

Recent radiocarbon-$\delta^{13}$C synthesis demonstrates that the glacial Atlantic stored enhanced respired carbon specifically in the depth range 2000--4000~m where AABW replaced NADW \citep{Skinner2016}. Our simulated depth-dependent age increases (Fig.~12--13) match this pattern: maximum aging occurs at abyssal depths where AABW dominates, while shallower depths show more modest changes reflecting NADW-AABW competition. The mechanism we diagnose---sea ice-driven shift to haline-enhanced, denser AABW formation---provides the physical driver for this biogeochemical restructuring.

\subsubsection{Regional proxy evidence and model-data synthesis}

Beyond basin-scale patterns, regional proxy compilations enable more detailed model-data comparison. Our simulated LIG Ross Sea age anomaly (up to -150~yr younger than PI; Fig.~11) reflects reduced sea ice coverage and enhanced thermal forcing in this sector. While high-resolution proxy records from the Ross Sea spanning LIG remain limited, existing evidence suggests enhanced polynya activity and potential AABW intensification during warm periods \citep{McKay2012}, qualitatively consistent with our mechanism diagnosis. Conversely, Weddell Sea sediment cores document persistent AABW export throughout interglacials with modest variability \citep{Hayes2014}, matching our simulated modest age changes in this region during MH/LIG.

Synthesizing across multiple proxy types---radiocarbon ages, $\epsilon_{Nd}$, $\delta^{13}$C, and regional records---our model-diagnosed mechanisms achieve first-order consistency with geological constraints. The simulated 1500-year ventilation age increase, thermal-to-haline forcing transition, and regional heterogeneity align with independent proxy evidence despite model limitations in formation processes. This consistency supports our central conclusion that sea ice governs AABW's climate response through its dual thermal-insulation and haline-intensification roles.

\subsection{Theoretical understanding and mechanistic synthesis}

Our results illuminate theoretical predictions for how AABW responds to climate forcing, connecting to fundamental frameworks for Southern Ocean dynamics.

\subsubsection{Water mass transformation theory and observations}

The WMT framework \citep{Walin1982, Groeskamp2019} provides thermodynamic basis for relating surface buoyancy fluxes to dense water formation rates. Our decomposition into individual heat and salt components (Section 3.2--3.3) extends recent observational WMT applications \citep{Pellichero2018, Bailey2023} into paleoclimate domain. Critically, \citet{Pellichero2018} used Argo floats and instrumented seals to show that seasonal sea ice growth and melt dominates water mass transformation in the ice-covered sector, with freshwater fluxes rather than heat fluxes driving meridional overturning feeding AABW formation---observing approximately 5$\pm$5~Sv transformation into denser AABW classes. Our interglacial results show comparable WMT magnitudes (5--8~Sv winter transformation at $\sigma_2$ = 36.6--36.8~kg/m$^3$; Fig.~9) but with heat flux dominance (70--80\% thermal contribution) rather than freshwater dominance.

This apparent discrepancy reflects different spatial domains and temporal averaging. \citet{Pellichero2018} integrated over the entire ice-covered Southern Ocean including the strong freshwater-driven upper cell transformation, whereas our focus on dense water classes ($\sigma_2$ $>$ 36.5~kg/m$^3$) isolates the AABW precursor formation specifically. Regional analysis by \citet{Bailey2023} for the Weddell Sea demonstrates that sea ice brine rejection dominates surface salt flux throughout most seasons, consistent with our glacial results showing 25--30\% sea ice contribution. The climate-dependent partitioning we diagnose---interglacial thermal dominance versus glacial haline enhancement---reflects that expanded sea ice fundamentally restructures the relative importance of formation pathways.

\subsubsection{Sea ice-ocean-atmosphere coupling and climate feedbacks}

Sea ice's dual role illuminated by our analysis connects to theoretical understanding of polar ocean-atmosphere coupling. The thermal insulation effect we diagnose (glacial ocean experiencing reduced heat loss despite colder air; Fig.~4) has been recognized in sea ice physics for decades but rarely quantified in paleoclimate WMT context. \citet{Abernathey2016} described sea ice as a ``freshwater pump'' that removes freshwater from high latitudes through equatorward transport and melting, concentrating salt in formation regions. Our surface flux decomposition (Fig.~6--7) demonstrates this pump operating with enhanced intensity during glacials: coastal brine rejection intensifies while offshore melting decreases, creating spatial partitioning that localizes dense water formation.

This sea ice-mediated forcing restructuring creates a climate feedback: expanded glacial sea ice $\rightarrow$ reduced area-integrated heat loss but intensified localized brine rejection $\rightarrow$ formation shifts to higher density classes $\rightarrow$ denser AABW spreads farther and resists mixing $\rightarrow$ enhanced stratification isolates deep ocean $\rightarrow$ reduced CO$_2$ outgassing $\rightarrow$ contributes to maintaining expanded sea ice. This positive feedback loop potentially explains the persistence of glacial deep ocean isolation documented in proxy records \citep{Ferrari2014, Jansen2017}. Breaking this feedback during deglaciations likely requires external forcing (orbital changes, ice sheet collapse, freshwater discharge) rather than internal variability \citep{Sigman2021}.

\subsubsection{SAM variability and decadal-to-centennial modulation}

Our SAM composite analysis (Section 3.5) demonstrates that atmospheric variability modulates AABW formation by 15--20\% on multi-year timescales across all climate states. This provides mechanistic explanation for observed decadal changes: 30\% Weddell Sea AABW reduction since 1992 linked to wind-driven sea ice decline \citep{Zhou2023}, and 2015--2019 Ross Sea recovery from positive SAM combined with El Niño forcing \citep{Silvano2020}. Critically, our finding that SAM-AABW coupling persists across glacial-interglacial cycles with similar relative sensitivity (despite dramatically different background conditions) suggests fundamental atmosphere-ocean-sea ice physics operating independently of climate state.

This has implications for interpreting proxy records. If SAM variability consistently modulates formation by 15--20\%, high-resolution sediment cores from AABW formation regions should preserve sub-centennial variability reflecting past SAM fluctuations. Existing radiocarbon records rarely achieve this resolution due to bioturbation and dating uncertainties, but emerging techniques (paleointensity-assisted chronologies, annual-layer counting in high-accumulation sites) could enable SAM reconstruction extending beyond instrumental records. Such reconstructions would test whether SAM frequency and amplitude changed across climate states---a critical unknown for understanding Southern Hemisphere climate dynamics.

\subsection{Implications for future climate projections}

While our study focuses on paleoclimate states, the mechanistic insights have direct relevance for projecting 21st-century deep ocean changes.

\subsubsection{Antarctic meltwater forcing and formation pathway shifts}

Projected Antarctic ice sheet mass loss could discharge substantial freshwater into AABW formation regions, with modeling studies suggesting more than 40\% abyssal overturning slowdown by 2050 under high-emission scenarios \citep{Li2023Nature}. Our analysis indicates this freshwater forcing would not simply weaken formation but rather \textit{shift formation mechanisms}---potentially toward even more haline-dominated pathways if sea ice responses amplify brine rejection in remaining formation regions. However, the nonlinearity is critical: beyond a threshold freshwater flux, stratification could prevent convection entirely, as observed in the Amundsen Sea where glacial meltwater halts deep water formation despite active polynyas \citep{Silvano2018}.

Our paleoclimate results provide constraints on this threshold. During LIG---our warmest simulation with reduced sea ice---Ross Sea formation continued with enhanced thermal forcing rather than shutting down, suggesting that moderate warming intensifies rather than eliminates formation. However, transient freshwater pulses during deglaciation (not captured in our equilibrium simulations) caused millennial-scale AABW weakening events \citep{Hayes2014, Glasscock2020}, indicating that \textit{rate} of change matters beyond equilibrium state. Future projections require transient simulations with realistic ice sheet-ocean coupling to capture threshold behavior.

\subsubsection{Climate model evaluation metrics from paleoclimate constraints}

Our mechanistic benchmarks provide quantitative targets for evaluating climate models used in future projections. Models that correctly simulate: (1) thermal-to-haline forcing transition with sea ice expansion (interglacial 85--90\% thermal shifting to glacial 70--75\% thermal, 25--30\% haline); (2) sea ice's dual thermal-insulation and haline-intensification roles; (3) SAM-driven 15--20\% WMT modulation across climate states; and (4) ventilation age increases of $\sim$1500~yr during glacial expansion---demonstrate realistic atmosphere-ocean-sea ice coupling essential for credible future projections.

Recent paleoclimate-based model evaluation \citep{Zhu2021NCC} shows that models passing paleoclimate tests exhibit reduced uncertainty in future projections, with paleoclimate constraints cutting projected warming ranges by approximately 30\%. Applying similar methodology to AABW specifically---using our WMT mechanism metrics as evaluation criteria---could identify which CMIP7 models most reliably project future deep ocean circulation changes. This is critical because inter-model spread in projected AABW response currently spans factors of 2--3 \citep{Heuze2021}, limiting confidence in climate impact assessments.

\subsection{Remaining uncertainties and future research priorities}

Despite advances, critical uncertainties require targeted investigation:

\subsubsection{High-resolution process studies}

Our diagnosed mechanisms---polynya heat loss, coastal brine rejection, dense water descent---operate at spatial scales ($\sim$10--100~km) unresolved by climate models. High-resolution regional modeling ($\sim$2--4~km) of key formation sites (Weddell Sea, Ross Sea, Cape Darnley) with realistic bathymetry and ice shelf cavities is essential to validate whether climate-model-diagnosed WMT translates to realistic overflow dynamics \citep{Schmidt2025}. Such studies would quantify: What fraction of surface-transformed dense water reaches abyssal depths versus mixing away during descent? How do bathymetric features control cascade pathways? How does ice shelf cavity circulation modify source water properties?

\subsubsection{Transient simulations across climate transitions}

Our equilibrium snapshots cannot capture millennial-scale variability during deglaciations when most dramatic circulation changes occurred. Transient simulations (following TRACE-21ka approach \citep{Liu2009}) spanning full glacial cycles with comprehensive WMT diagnostics would test whether formation mechanism shifts lead or lag atmospheric CO$_2$ changes---addressing causality questions central to understanding terminations \citep{Sigman2021}. Particular focus on Heinrich stadials and Antarctic Cold Reversal would illuminate abrupt AABW responses to freshwater forcing.

\subsubsection{Multi-proxy model-data integration}

Incorporating multiple tracers ($^{14}$C, $\delta^{13}$C, $\delta^{18}$O, $\epsilon_{Nd}$) into WMT framework via proxy system models would enable quantitative model-data comparison using identical metrics. Key question: Does thermally-dominated versus haline-enhanced formation produce distinguishable proxy signatures? This requires isotope-enabled simulations \citep{Menviel2017, Gu2019} combined with comprehensive sediment core compilations and Bayesian model-data fusion techniques \citep{Tierney2020Paleo}.

\subsubsection{Improved representation of key processes}

Next-generation models require improved parameterizations of: (1) coastal polynyas maintaining open water in katabatic wind zones; (2) dense water overflows navigating complex bathymetry; (3) ice shelf cavity circulation and melting; and (4) sub-grid-scale sea ice thickness distributions affecting brine rejection efficiency. Process studies comparing explicitly resolved versus parameterized representations would guide development. Recent advances show that overflow parameterizations can achieve accurate AABW properties even at coarse resolution when properly tuned \citep{Schmidt2025}, offering a tractable path forward.

\section{Conclusions}

This study systematically quantifies AABW formation mechanisms across five paleoclimate states spanning full glacial-interglacial amplitude using water mass transformation analysis and ideal age tracer simulations in AWI-ESM. Our key findings are:

\textbf{(1) Climate-dependent formation mechanisms and sea ice's dual role.} Interglacial AABW precursor water formation is dominated by thermal forcing (heat loss to atmosphere), with sea ice brine rejection contributing $<$15\% of total transformation. Glacial periods exhibit shifted mechanisms: while heat flux remains dominant, sea ice freshwater forcing intensifies to 25--30\% of transformation and drives densification to higher $\sigma_2$ classes (37.0--37.5~kg/m$^3$ versus 36.6--36.8~kg/m$^3$). Critically, surface buoyancy flux decomposition reveals that glacial sea ice expansion creates a \textit{thermal insulation effect} that reduces area-integrated ocean heat loss, while simultaneously \textit{intensifying localized brine rejection} in persistent coastal polynyas. This dual role---bulk ocean insulation combined with coastal polynya concentration---fundamentally restructures the surface forcing of AABW formation rather than simply strengthening or weakening it.

\textbf{(2) Ventilation age response.} Glacial deep ocean isolation increases by $\sim$1500~yr globally, consistent with radiocarbon proxy constraints \citep{Skinner2017}. However, regional heterogeneity is pronounced: LIG Ross Sea exhibits younger ages ($-$150~yr) attributed to reduced sea ice and enhanced thermal forcing, while the Pacific shows the strongest glacial aging (up to 2500~yr below 3000~m). These age patterns directly link surface WMT changes to abyssal ventilation response.

\textbf{(3) SAM-AABW coupling across climate states.} The Southern Annular Mode exerts systematic control on AABW formation across all paleoclimate periods, modulating transformation rates by 15--20\% during high-SAM versus low-SAM phases. This influence operates through combined thermal (enhanced heat loss) and haline (intensified sea ice dynamics) forcing, with climate-dependent partitioning: interglacial SAM impacts are 70--80\% thermal, whereas glacial periods shift toward 60--65\% thermal and 35--40\% haline. The persistent SAM-AABW teleconnection across glacial-interglacial cycles demonstrates fundamental atmosphere-ocean-sea ice coupling that transcends individual climate states, providing mechanistic explanation for observed decadal AABW variability and establishing quantitative benchmarks for model validation.

\textbf{(4) Implications for carbon storage and climate variability.} The combination of enhanced stratification (from denser source waters), increased ventilation ages, and expanded sea ice coverage during glacials creates conditions for efficient deep ocean carbon sequestration, potentially explaining 50--80~ppm of glacial-interglacial CO$_2$ variations \citep{Skinner2017, Ferrari2014}. Superimposed on these long-term climate state changes, SAM variability drives multi-year to decadal AABW fluctuations that modulate deep ocean ventilation and biogeochemical cycling on societally-relevant timescales. The observed 30\% Weddell Sea AABW reduction since 1992 \citep{Zhou2023} and projected Antarctic meltwater-driven slowdown \citep{Li2023Nature} occur against this background of natural SAM-forced variability, complicating attribution and emphasizing the need for sustained observations spanning multiple SAM cycles.

\subsection{Future research directions}

Our analysis reveals critical knowledge gaps requiring targeted investigation:

\subsubsection{Immediate priorities}

\textbf{(1) Shelf processes and dense water cascades.} The current model produces AABW through open-ocean convection rather than realistic shelf overflow mechanisms \citep{Heuze2021}. High-resolution regional modeling ($\sim$2--4~km) of key formation sites (Weddell Sea, Ross Sea, Adélie Coast, Cape Darnley) is essential to validate whether WMT-diagnosed formation mechanisms translate to realistic overflow dynamics. Specifically: How do polynya heat loss and brine rejection combine to produce Dense Shelf Water? What bathymetric features control cascade pathways? How does ice shelf cavity circulation modify source water properties?

\textbf{(2) Sea ice-ocean coupling sensitivity.} Our results highlight sea ice as the critical control on glacial-interglacial WMT differences, yet sea ice remains poorly constrained in paleoclimate models \citep{Lhardy2022}. Sensitivity experiments systematically varying sea ice extent, thickness, and seasonal cycle---guided by proxy reconstructions---would quantify how sea ice uncertainties propagate to AABW formation estimates. Coupling to dynamic ice sheet models would address ice shelf cavity geometry changes and glacial meltwater forcing.

\textbf{(3) Transient simulations across deglaciations.} Our equilibrium snapshots cannot capture millennial-scale AABW variability during climate transitions. Transient simulations (similar to TRACE-21ka \citep{Liu2009}) spanning deglaciations would test whether WMT-diagnosed formation changes lead or lag atmospheric CO$_2$ rise, addressing causality questions central to understanding glacial terminations \citep{Sigman2021}. Particular focus on Heinrich stadials and Antarctic Cold Reversal would illuminate abrupt AABW responses to freshwater forcing.

\subsubsection{Advanced mechanistic investigations}

\textbf{(4) WMT closure and internal mixing.} Current WMT analysis diagnoses surface transformation but does not track subsurface mixing and entrainment that modify water mass properties during descent and spreading. Lagrangian trajectory analysis combined with inline WMT diagnostics would quantify: What fraction of surface-transformed dense water reaches abyssal depths? How do diapycnal mixing and geothermal heating alter AABW properties during transit? This connects surface formation to abyssal arrival, completing the mechanistic chain.

\textbf{(5) Biogeochemical tracer integration.} Incorporating carbon, oxygen, nutrients, and isotopic tracers ($\delta^{13}$C, $\delta^{18}$O, $\Delta^{14}$C) into WMT framework would enable direct model-proxy comparison using identical metrics. Specifically: Does thermally-dominated versus haline-enhanced formation produce distinguishable biogeochemical signatures? Can WMT-based formation estimates explain observed nutrient distributions in paleo-reconstructions? This requires fully coupled carbon cycle modeling with comprehensive tracer suite.

\textbf{(6) Polynya parameterization evaluation.} Most climate models fail to maintain persistent coastal polynyas---critical AABW formation sites \citep{Dufour2017}. Process studies comparing explicitly resolved polynyas (in high-resolution models) against parameterized representations (in climate models) would identify which physical processes require sub-grid-scale treatment. Outcomes would guide development of improved polynya parameterizations for next-generation climate models.

\subsubsection{Synthesis and climate projection}

\textbf{(7) Multi-model intercomparison.} Applying identical WMT analysis framework across PMIP4/CMIP6 ensemble would assess inter-model spread in diagnosed formation mechanisms. Key question: Do models agreeing on AABW transport changes achieve agreement through similar or compensating mechanistic pathways? This would identify robust versus model-dependent conclusions, guiding model development priorities.

\textbf{(8) Future climate applications.} Extending WMT analysis to high-emission future scenarios (SSP5-8.5) would quantify how projected Antarctic ice sheet melt \citep{Li2023Nature} alters formation mechanisms. Critical question: Does freshwater-driven stratification shut down AABW formation entirely, or shift mechanisms toward reduced thermal/enhanced haline forcing? Answering this requires sustained CMIP7-era simulations with interactive ice sheets and comprehensive WMT diagnostics.

These research directions would transform understanding from descriptive ("AABW weakens/strengthens") to mechanistic ("AABW formation shifts from thermal to haline dominance because expanded sea ice insulates surface while concentrating brine rejection in polynyas"), providing predictive capability essential for projecting 21st-century deep ocean changes and carbon cycle feedbacks.

PI/MH/LIG show 200--400~m MLD in polynyas; glacials exceed 500~m in Atlantic sector consistent with enhanced convection. (f--j) Sea ice concentration (fraction 0--1). Glacial simulations display circumpolar coverage extending to $\sim$50°S; LIG shows reduced extent compared to PI, particularly in Ross and Weddell Seas.

(e--h) Wind stress anomalies (N/m$^2$) with PI wind stress vectors. LIG shows poleward-shifted, strengthened westerlies ($\Delta\tau$ $>$ 0.04 N/m$^2$ in 50--60°S band). Glacials exhibit equatorward-shifted, weakened westerlies with widespread stress reduction. These atmospheric circulation changes directly modulate Ekman upwelling and polynya ventilation efficiency, contributing to altered AABW formation pathways.

\textbf{Figure 4: Surface heat flux components during austral winter (JJA).}
\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}
Panel structure: 3 rows × 5 columns. Column 1 shows PI absolute values; columns 2--5 show paleoclimate anomalies (paleo minus PI). All heat fluxes shown from ocean's perspective (negative values indicate heat loss to atmosphere). (a--e) Total heat flux combining all atmospheric heat exchange processes (SW+LW+LH+SH). Red indicates ocean cooling (heat loss to atmosphere); blue indicates reduced cooling relative to PI. (f--j) Radiative component (SW+LW) isolating shortwave and longwave radiation contributions. (k--o) Turbulent component (LH+SH) isolating latent and sensible heat fluxes. Units: kJ~s$^{-1}$~m$^{-2}$. Glacial periods (LGM, MIS3) show dramatically reduced ocean heat loss due to sea ice thermal insulation, with turbulent flux reduction exceeding radiative changes. This paradoxical ocean warming (less cooling) despite colder atmospheric temperatures reflects expanded sea ice blocking ocean-atmosphere turbulent heat exchange.

\textbf{Figure 5: Surface heat flux components during austral summer (DJF).}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/surface_heat_budget_anomalies_djf.pdf}
\end{figure}
Same structure as Fig.~4 but for austral summer (December-January-February). The sea ice insulation effect persists during summer in glacial ice-covered sectors, though with reduced magnitude compared to winter. Summer patterns confirm that the thermal insulation mechanism is intrinsic to ice cover rather than a winter-only phenomenon, operating year-round with seasonal modulation.

\textbf{Figure 6: Surface freshwater/mass flux components during austral winter (JJA).}

(k--o) Other freshwater sources (P+E+R+S) combining precipitation, evaporation, runoff, and snowfall. Units: kg~s$^{-1}$~m$^{-2}$. Glacial periods show intensified coastal brine rejection (red in panels i,j row 2) coinciding with reduced offshore ice melt, enhancing haline forcing of dense water formation in coastal polynyas. The spatial partitioning of sea ice effects---coastal intensification combined with offshore reduction---drives the shift to haline-enhanced AABW formation mechanisms during glacials.

\textbf{Figure 7: Surface freshwater/mass flux components during austral summer (DJF).}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/surface_freshwater_budget_anomalies_djf.pdf}
\end{figure}
Same structure as Fig.~6 but for austral summer. The seasonal cycle reverses: sea ice formation in winter (Fig.~6f: positive salt tendency, red) transitions to sea ice melt in summer (Fig.~7f: negative salt tendency, blue), releasing freshwater back to the ocean. Glacial anomalies (Fig.~7i,j) show \textit{reduced} summer ice melt compared to PI (less negative values), meaning suppressed freshwater release. This asymmetry---enhanced winter brine rejection combined with reduced summer freshwater release---creates net annual haline forcing that enhances glacial AABW formation. The expanded glacial ice pack acts as a seasonal freshwater reservoir, amplifying the annual salinity cycle.

\end{figure}
Annual mean WMT rates (Sv) as a function of $\sigma_2$ density for four Southern Ocean regions: Southern Ocean (sum of all), Ross Sea, Weddell Sea, and Adélie Land. Each panel shows 5 experiments (PI, MH, LIG, LGM, MIS3). Lines indicate: total WMT (black), total heat flux contribution (red), sea ice freshwater contribution (teal), and other freshwater sources (blue). Interglacials show thermal dominance (85--90\% heat flux) at $\sigma_2$ = 36.6--36.8 kg/m$^3$ with modest sea ice contribution (<15\%). Glacials shift to higher densities ($\sigma_2$ = 37.0--37.5 kg/m$^3$) with enhanced sea ice forcing (25--30\% of total), reflecting the mechanism transition from heat-dominated to haline-enhanced AABW formation.

\textbf{Figure 9: Water mass transformation (WMT) in density space - winter mean.}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/plot_wmt_4regions_5exps_winter.pdf}
\end{figure}
Same structure as Fig.~8 but for austral winter (JJA) when AABW formation is most vigorous. Winter WMT amplitudes exceed annual means by factor of 2--3, with Southern Ocean peaks reaching 40--60~Sv (interglacials) to >60~Sv (glacials). The relative importance of sea ice forcing increases during winter, particularly in glacial periods where coastal polynya brine rejection drives 25--30\% of total transformation. Regional patterns show Weddell Sea as primary formation site (strongest glacial intensification), while Adélie Land maintains persistent heat-flux-driven transformation across all climate states.

Horizontal distribution of ideal age (years) at 3900~m depth for five experiments. Interglacials (PI/MH/LIG) exhibit young ages (0--500~yr) in Atlantic/Indian sectors with oldest waters (>1000~yr) in Pacific. Glacials (LGM/MIS3) show dramatically older ages: Atlantic/Indian exceed 1500~yr, Pacific reaches 2000--2500~yr. This represents ~1500-year global increase in deep ocean isolation, consistent with radiocarbon proxy reconstructions. Spatial patterns reflect reduced AABW formation rates and enhanced stratification under glacial boundary conditions.

Age anomalies (years) at 3900~m for paleoclimate states relative to PI. MH shows minimal changes (±50~yr). LIG reveals younger ages (up to -150~yr) in Ross Sea sector attributed to reduced sea ice and enhanced thermal forcing, with modest increases (+50~yr) in Weddell Sea. Glacials display spatially coherent increases: LGM/MIS3 show +400 to +1500~yr across all basins, with maximum values in deep Pacific where sluggish circulation compounds the aging effect. Regional heterogeneity highlights sensitivity to local changes in surface forcing and circulation pathways.

Basin-averaged vertical age profiles (years vs depth) for Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans across five experiments. Interglacials show modest depth-increasing ages: Atlantic/Indian 500--750~yr at 4000~m, Pacific 800--1200~yr. Glacials exhibit systematically older ages with strong depth dependence: Atlantic reaches 1500--2000~yr, Pacific exceeds 2500~yr below 3000~m (tripling relative to PI). Indian Ocean shows intermediate behavior. These profiles quantify basin-specific ventilation changes and demonstrate that Pacific deep waters experience most dramatic aging under glacial conditions due to remoteness from AABW formation regions.

Basin-averaged age anomaly profiles (years vs depth, relative to PI). MH exhibits minimal anomalies (<±100~yr). LIG shows slight rejuvenation in Atlantic (-75 to -150~yr throughout water column) from enhanced AABW formation, while Pacific shows modest increases (+100~yr deep). Glacials display depth-increasing anomalies: LGM/MIS3 reach +1500~yr in deep Pacific, +800~yr in Atlantic, +500~yr in Indian. The systematic depth-dependence reflects reduced ventilation at depth where sluggish abyssal circulation magnifies the impact of reduced AABW formation rates. These anomaly profiles isolate pure climate-driven ventilation changes independent of baseline circulation structure.

Austral winter (JJA) mean surface heat flux anomalies for high-SAM minus low-SAM composites (1$\sigma$ threshold) across five paleoclimate states. Panel structure: 3 rows × 5 columns (PI/MH/LIG/LGM/MIS3). Row 1: Total heat flux (all components combined). Row 2: Radiative component (longwave + shortwave). Row 3: Turbulent component (sensible + latent heat). Units: W/m$^2$ from ocean perspective (positive indicates reduced ocean heat loss during high-SAM). High-SAM conditions systematically enhance ocean heat loss (negative anomalies, blue colors) exceeding 15~W/m$^2$ in the circumpolar 50--65°S band. Turbulent fluxes contribute 60--70\% of total anomaly. Glacial periods (LGM/MIS3) show reduced SAM-driven variability due to sea ice insulation dampening atmosphere-ocean exchange. The Ross Sea exhibits strongest SAM sensitivity during interglacials (>20~W/m$^2$), consistent with reduced sea ice buffering.

Austral winter (JJA) mean freshwater flux anomalies for high-SAM minus low-SAM composites (1$\sigma$ threshold) across five paleoclimate states. Panel structure: 3 rows × 5 columns. Row 1: Total freshwater flux. Row 2: Sea ice component (brine rejection and melt). Row 3: Other sources (precipitation + evaporation + runoff + snowfall). Units: mm/day (positive indicates net freshwater gain to ocean, negative indicates salinification). High-SAM drives complex dipole patterns with coastal freshwater loss (salinification from enhanced brine rejection) and offshore gain (from ice melt). The sea ice component (row 2) dominates other sources (row 3) by factors of 3--5, confirming that SAM influences AABW primarily through haline forcing via sea ice redistribution. Glacial periods exhibit amplified responses (>1.0~mm/day) due to expanded baseline sea ice coverage providing larger reservoir for SAM-driven redistribution.

Austral winter (JJA) water mass transformation composites showing high-SAM minus low-SAM differences (Sv) as a function of $\sigma_2$ density for four Southern Ocean regions. Panel structure: 4 rows (Southern Ocean total, Ross Sea, Weddell Sea, Adélie Land) × 5 columns (PI/MH/LIG/LGM/MIS3). Each panel shows total WMT anomaly (black), total heat flux contribution (red), sea ice freshwater contribution (teal), and other freshwater sources (blue). High-SAM systematically enhances transformation across all density classes and climate states, with maximum impacts at dense water range ($\sigma_2$ > 36.5~kg/m$^3$). Interglacial winters show 5--8~Sv WMT increase during high-SAM at $\sigma_2$ = 36.6--36.8~kg/m$^3$ (15--20\% modulation). Ross Sea exhibits strongest SAM sensitivity (3--4~Sv increase), while Weddell Sea shows modest response (1--2~Sv). Glacial periods shift WMT anomalies toward higher densities ($\sigma_2$ = 37.0--37.5~kg/m$^3$) but maintain similar relative sensitivity (15--20\%), demonstrating that SAM-AABW coupling persists across glacial-interglacial cycles.
